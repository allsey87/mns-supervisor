// how often should we ping, every 500 ms?

// a more clever way of doing this could involve looking for failed operations/only pinging devices that we not responding
// this would involve keeping a last_error: Option<Error>, last_operation: Option<Instant> variable in the devices

// this would reduce congestion but would not speed up the operation of pinging since we would have the collection locked for
// that duration anyway

// Does it make sense to make individual robots lockable?

// type Robots = Arc<RwLock<Vec<robot::Robot>>>;
// type Robots = Arc<RwLock<Vec<RwLock<robot::Robot>>>>;

// in this way, even if robot state needed to be changed, we would only ever need to lock the outer collection if we were
// adding/removing robots

// if it is determined that a robot is not responding, should we remove it from the collection? This could be dangerous for a
// drone under the control of ARGoS, 

// Each device (ssh/xbee) could have a state online/offline, instead of removing the device from the collection,
// it could be marked as inactive, and we could try here to reestablish that connection

// For long running processes such as ARGoS, it may make sense to run this inside tmux or screen such that SSH disconnects and
// reconnects are not effected. Upon reconnect, ARGoS should be detected and handled appropiately
